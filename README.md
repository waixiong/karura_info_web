# Karura Info
This is Non Official Karura Info page. Was working on [karura-dex-analysis](https://github.com/waixiong/karura-dex-analysis), but decide to change the project structure. Current design will be totally depends on only subql instead of required another api server for calculation.

### Current Issue
The subquery stuck at block 438150, Deploying my own node see if able to solve the issue.

### Current status
The plan will be fully utilize subql if possible. However, there are some part may need polkadot.js.
